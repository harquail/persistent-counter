# Persistent Counter

[Demo Video](https://youtu.be/C6ezaJtyUD8)

A simple counter view controller that allows you to add named counters, and increment/decrement their value.  Counters can also be re-ordered and deleted.

I used [Realm](https://realm.io/) to persist counter data, including positions.
